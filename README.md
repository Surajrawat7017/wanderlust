## 📖 Project Overview

WanderLust provides a comprehensive platform where users can explore travel destinations and share detailed listings. Each listing includes images, descriptions, pricing, location details, and user reviews. Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own listings, while visitors can browse and review destinations.

The application follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to ensure better organization, maintainability, and scalability. Third-party services are integrated for cloud image storage and map visualization, along with secure authentication and authorization.
